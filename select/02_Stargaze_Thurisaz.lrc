[00:32.08] Never thought upon a million stars
[00:42.06] That I would ever see a sight this bright
[00:56.28] Now I have to walk into her light
[01:08.74] Make sure I'll never fear her frightening eyes
[01:31.74] 
[02:48.38] I didn't even had a doubt in me
[02:51.42] The brightest star I've ever seen
[03:35.15] It shines on forever
